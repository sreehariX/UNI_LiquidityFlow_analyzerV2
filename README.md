# Uniswap Liquidity Flow Analyzer Subgraph

This project focuses on creating a subgraph for analyzing liquidity flows in Uniswap. The subgraph collects and organizes data related to liquidity provision and swap events, providing insights into market activity on the Uniswap platform.

## Project Overview

The subgraph tracks important events in the Uniswap ecosystem, including:

- **Liquidity Provision:** Monitoring when users add liquidity to pools.
- **Liquidity Removal:** Tracking when users withdraw liquidity from pools.
- **Swap Events:** Capturing trade activities between tokens in different pools.



## Features

- **Real-Time Data:** The subgraph provides real-time data on liquidity flows, enabling users to analyze market activity as it happens.
- **Historical Data:** Users can query historical liquidity provision, removal, and swap events to identify trends over time.
- **Efficient Querying:** The subgraph leverages The Graph's indexing capabilities, allowing for efficient querying of complex data.



## Example DApps

Below are examples of decentralized applications (DApps) that can be built using this subgraph:
